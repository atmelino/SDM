Web Server Installation

sudo apt-get install tasksel

sudo tasksel

To test, open web browser and enter localhost.

the web root, in other words the location where the content is locacted, is /var/www/html.

If you want to change the location to a different one:

If the location is a mounted drive, make sure that the location has permissions that allow access for the web server:

sudo chmod 755 /mnt/data

If you have problems, it helps to look a tt he error log at /var/log/apache2/error.log

if you prefer a graphical editor in superuser mode:
SUDO_EDITOR="gedit -w" sudoedit /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
